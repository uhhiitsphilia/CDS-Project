              " 'Homelessness (or Houselessness as George Carlin stated) has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school, work, or vote for the matter. Most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism, the war on Iraq, pressuring kids to succeed, technology, the elections, inflation, or worrying if theyll be next to end up on the streets.But what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home, the entertainment sets, a bathroom, pictures on the wall, a computer, and everything you once treasure to see what its like to be homeless? That is Goddard Bolts lesson.Mel Brooks (who directs) who stars as Bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival (Jeffery Tambor) to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries; if Bolt succeeds, he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings. The bets on where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he cant step off the sidewalk. Hes given the nickname Pepto by a vagrant after its written on his forehead where Bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of Molly (Lesley Ann Warren) an ex-dancer who got divorce before losing her home, and her pals Sailor (Howard Morris) and Fumes (Teddy Wilson) who are already used to the streets. Theyre survivors. Bolt isnt. Hes not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where its fight or flight, kill or be killed.While the love connection between Molly and Bolt wasnt necessary to plot, I found \"Life Stinks\" to be one of Mel Brooks observant films where prior to being a comedy, it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, or Spaceballs for the matter, to show what its like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they dont know what to do with their money. Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like Monopoly money.Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others.',\n",
              " 'Brilliant over-acting by Lesley Ann Warren. Best dramatic hobo lady I have ever seen, and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none. The corn on face is a classic, as good as anything in Blazing Saddles. The take on lawyers is also superb. After being accused of being a turncoat, selling out his boss, and being dishonest the lawyer of Pepto Bolt shrugs indifferently \"Im a lawyer\" he says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor, a favorite from the later Larry Sanders show, is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. His character is more malevolent than usual. The hospital scene, and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site, are all-time classics. Look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting (one bleeds). This movie gets better each time I see it (which is quite often).',\n",
              " 'This is easily the most underrated film inn the Brooks cannon. Sure, its flawed. It does not give a realistic view of homelessness (unlike, say, how Citizen Kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers, or Titanic gave a realistic view of Italians YOU IDIOTS). Many of the jokes fall flat. But still, this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not, and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive. Its not The Fisher King, but its not crap, either. My only complaint is that Brooks should have cast someone else in the lead (I love Mel as a Director and Writer, not so much as a lead).',\n",
              " 'This is not the typical Mel Brooks film. It was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable. Leslie Ann Warren made the movie, she is such a fantastic, under-rated actress. There were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more, and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so, but all in all, this is worth the price to rent and see it. The acting was good overall, Brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience. Again, Warren was the best actor in the movie, but \"Fume\" and \"Sailor\" both played their parts well.']"

(to answer one other user: I am not talk about someon who just realli doesnt like the movi that much, and gave it a 5 or a 6, etc. everyon has, and is entitl to, his/her own taste. but no one can convinc me that the imdb rate of onli 7.0 overal for \"titanic\", pull to that level by an inordin number of ridicul 1 ratings, is a fair reflect of the overal motion picture.)let me demonstr my point by compar the imdb user vote pattern of \"titanic\" to 5 randomli chosen box offic and critic \"bombs\" (there are mani more, but these 5 will prove my point). \"heaven gate\" (1980) wa pull from the theater quickli after a veri poor box offic showing, and imdb voter rate were: 23.2% 10 rate and 9.2% 1 rate (overal rate of 6.1). \"big top pee-wee\" (1988) got 4.3% 10 rate and 9.9% 1 rate (overal rate of 4.5). \"cat people\" (1982) got 6.1% 10 rate and 2.6% 1 rate (overal rate of 5.8). \"blind date\" (1987) got 3.0% 10 rate and 2.8% 1 rate (overal rate of 5.3). \"jumpin jack flash\" (1986) got 4.4% 10 rate and 3.7% 1 rate (overal rate of 5.2). what DO all OF these film have IN common with \"titanic\"? all OF the percentag OF their 1 rate are lower !!!! than \"titanic\", and none OF these stinker ever wa nomin for A singl award. again, \"titanic\" got 10.7% 1 ratings! compar that to the other 5 movi I just mentioned.can there be ani explan other than the hatr of leo factor?',\n",

As it stand today anyon can make a voyag to the titan and take whatev valuabl they as portray in the film show the gener valu of our time on thi matter.techn the film is veri well done. To get footag of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelv dive to get all of the footag need for the movie. In addition, a special camera had to be creat to withstand the intens pressur at the bottom of the ocean. cameron did not plan on use the probe to go as far insid titan as anyon ha in the 88 year sinc the ship sunk but it work out that thi provid an uniqu perspect into the ship. furthermore, throughout the film fade in and out from the wreck of titan to the scene of titan dure it actual voyage. thi shift between the modern scene to the past scene dure the voyag work as an excel transit that make the stori easi to follow in aclear manner. At the veri begin of the movi a septun recreat is use to recreat the scene when the actual peopl left the european coast on titan give it distinct from the rest of the event of the film.titan play almost like a histor biographi and is like a work of art, a true epic. like most histori novels, we know the ending, but it doesnt take away from the wonder treat that can be found in thi picture. certain aspect of thi film are academi award materi includ costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing.

In my opinion, though, steal the show wa franc fisher as rose mother. she wa perfect as the snobbi aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loath she felt everi time she look at jack. then - the details. Im no expert on the sink of the titanic, but I have a reason gener knowledge, and thi film doe a super job of recreat the histor detail accur and then weav them seamlessli around the fiction romance. veri impressive, indeed. then - the song. who can watch thi movi and not be taken with celin dion perform of \"mi heart goe on.\"problems. well, the romanc wa perhap too contrived, in the sens that I just dont accept that jack could have move so effortlessli from steerag to first class. (I know he wa invit the first time; but he seem to keep get into first class without be stop until he been there for a while.) the realiti of the separ of the social class were much more realist portrayed, I thought, when the steerag passeng were go to be left lock down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folk got to enjoy half empti lifeboats.

I didnt watch it a second time, but I think the begin would make more sens if I had (not that it confusing). the subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice, and I found myself go back and forth about whether I dislik the main charact for hi relationship with her or if I felt bad for him. he somewhat of an anti-hero to the whole story, if you will. I feel inclin to cheer for him as the protagonist, but he complet unlovable.whil the stuart gordon episod may be better and Im excit about the \"washingtonians\" episode, I think I could safe bet that thi is the key episod of the season and by far the save grace of what wa otherwis lacklust and routine. when legend like john carpent let me down (again) I get a bit worri about the genr future, but then a fresh face like rob schmidt come along and give me hope. thi one is a keeper, and pleas bring schmidt back for season 3!',\n",

A vow TO cherish is, without ani doubt, one of the movi that now constitut a real surpris I have receiv from cinema. here are some argument of mine whi I consid thi film a highli underr piec of good cinema. first, the entir content is particularli educational. It ha someth to offer to the modern audienc - pure right faith and some answer for the univers questions. Is there a need for christ in our times? doe love still matter? what for is there faith? what is the logic of burden and suffer in life? Is there realli someon by my side I can alway trust? the movi provid the answer through the content sinc all that happen to the charact may as well happen to ani of us.second, the movi is except humane. the main charact experi inner struggl and cope with extrem hard decisions. Is it better for kyle david denman) and teri (megan paul) to start their own live and forget about the famili or retain the valu they were taught at home? Is it better for john (ken howard) to leav ellen (barbara babcock), hi sick wife, and start a new happi life with julia (donna bullock), a woman he fall in love with? In fact, ellen no longer recogn him... yet, he decid to vow hi wife etern fidelity. had john rebelli brother, phil (d. david morin), better go on hi easi life although it doe not bring him satisfact or onc start to think serious of hi life. phil prayer to god in the park is a psycholog masterwork of univers aspect of humanity. these word could be as well said by everybodi no matter of where, when or how they live.third, the movi is a great portray of family, not veri popular nowadays: there are problems, yet, there is alway someth more power that get these peopl together. thi \"something\" is love and trust. I know that it may seem a bit idealistic. not all famili can reli on fidel and it may not be as simpl as that. nevertheless, it is a veri educ aspect and a realist one.fourth, the entir film focus on peopl mutual help. If we want to live happi live in our society, we must understand one thing: we have to help one another. alexand (ossi davis) is an exampl of such attitude. At the begin of the movie, we see him talk to john about praying. later, he help hi brother. alexand is a kinda \"angel\" that is sent to john and hi family. isnt it possibl that we may becom angel to one another?fifth, the artist featur are also worth attention. performances: barbara babcock give an authent perform as ellen and although she ha a difficult role, she doe a perfect job. consider, for instance, the moment she appear at school and badli want to teach again. ken howard is also memor as the faith husband. picture: the most memor for me wa the scene of john and ellen in the park walk on the fallen leav (autumn) while the sunshin (love) spread everywhere. I interpret as a sort of symbol: even if there is sorrow, thi can alway be illumin by light and joy...a vow TO cherish is a wonder movi that realist show to me what it mean to love, what fidel is as well it onc again prove to me how beauti it is to live and believe. At the end, I would like to quot the profound word from the movi I found veri touch and hope you will also do kyle to hi uncl phil: yes, he (john brighton) live accord to the bible. but nobodi forc you to do so. yet, accord to what rule do you live?',\n",

(there is, after all, her juvenil \"love and freindship\" (sic), the short novella \"ladi susan\", and someone, somewhere, ha doubtless suppli end to her two unfinish fragment \"the watsons\" and \"sanditon\". then there are all those austen sequel churn out by modern writer ).the main charact is emma woodhouse, a young ladi from an aristocrat famili in regenc england. (not, as some review have assumed, victorian england- austen die befor queen victoria wa even born). emma is, financially, consider better off than most austen heroin such as elizabeth bennett or fanni price, and ha no need to find herself a wealthi husband. instead, her main preoccup seem to be find husband for her friends. she persuad her friend harriet to turn down a propos of marriag from a young farmer, robert martin, believ that harriet should be set her sight on the ambiti clergyman Mr elton. thi scheme goe disastr wrong, however, as elton ha no interest in harriet, but ha fallen in love with emma herself. the speed with which emma reject hi propos make one wonder just whi she wa so keen to match her friend with a man she regard (with good reason) as an unsuit marriag partner for herself. thi be a jane austen plot, emma turn out to be less of a commit spinster than she seems, and she too find herself fall in love, lead to further complications.emma alway insist that she will not marri without affection, and when she doe find a partner, the handsom Mr knightley, we feel that thi will inde be an affection marriage. It doe not, however, seem like to be a veri passion one (unlike, say, that of elizabeth bennett and Mr darcy). knightley, who is sixteen year older than emma (she is 21, he 37), and relat to her by marriage, is more like a father-figur than a lover. much more of a father-figure, in fact, than her actual father, a querul and selfish old hypochondriac who seem more like her grandfather. when emma is rude to her unbear garrul and tediou friend miss bates, it is knightley who chide her for her lack of manners. (hi surnam is probabl meant to indic hi gentlemanli nature- nineteenth-centuri gentlemen like to think of themselv as the modern equival of mediaev knight with their elabor code of chivalry). both gwyneth paltrow and jeremi northam play their part veri well, but thi is not realli one of the great screen romances.of the other characters, I like juliet stephenson vulgar mr elton and toni collett harriet. I know that in the novel harriet wa a naïv young teenager, wherea here she is more like the charact collett play in \"muriel wedding\"- a gauche, slightli overweight twentysomething, fret about her chanc of find a man. nevertheless, I felt that thi characteris work well in the context of the film and did not detract from austen themes.\"emma\" is one of austen more light-heart works, without the darker overton of \"mansfield park\" or even \"pride and prejudice\", and thi is reflect on screen. We see a world of beauti and grace, full of state home and eleg costum and fine manners. apart from the ruffianli gypsies, who make a veri brief appearance, the onli \"poor\" peopl we see are mr bate and her daughter, and, as they live in the sort of picturesqu rose-strewn thatch cottag which today would chang hand for over £500,000, we can be sure that their poverti is relative, not absolute. In emma world, poverti is defin as not have your own state home. thi is, of course, not a comprehens pictur of earli nineteenth-centuri life, but nobodi ha ever claim austen as the regenc equival of a kitchen-sink realist. sophist romant comedy, combin with a keen eye for analys human character, wa more in her line.i would not rate thi film quit as highli as the 1994 \"sens and sensibility\" or the recent \"pride and prejudice\"- it tend to drag a bit in the middle, although it ha a strong begin and strong ending- but it is, in the main, a highli enjoy austen adaptation. 7/10',\n",

It is clear that in order to pull thi off, the cast ha to be more than up for the task, becaus in a world where noth exist there is noth that can distract the viewer in ani way. vincenzo ha decid to use a reason amount of close-up head shot to make it more interest and it actual work quit well. director of photography, derek rogers, also ha a nice way of teas the audienc by withhold visual information, especi at time where a charact see someth and react to it, but we dont see it right away.obviously, thi cant be an event driven film and it not. much of the action happen outsid their hous when they move around in the void. and that where some of the most hilari scene take place, especi in the case of when andrew discov a candi bar.now, one could be thinking: \"how doe noth look like?\" well, it look like noth indeed. the entir world of noth is white... white no matter in what direct you look. thi is the weak of thi film... after an hour or less it get extrem bore to look at and there ha to be event to make sure it more interest to look at. thank god, there are some. for exampl at time when the two lads, due to the properti of nothing, are abl to jump realli high as if noth is made out of... tofu (a andrew claims). it fun to see how they are instantli abl to use noth to becom god of their own littl society.on of the best part of the film is the set... product design jasna stefanov ha done a beauti job in thi film, the hous in which these two guy live is so unnatur fun to look at, still it seem right for these two to be live in a place like this. all in all, the product design is with no doubt one of the most power aspect of thi film at it realli make the film worth watching...however, the veri best part of the film is the acting. both david hewlett and andrew miller realli look like the profession actor they both are. the camera is on them for everi second of the film and as previous said, there are just about no prop in the film, they are realli on a bare stage. with plenti of charact develop and some decent one-liners, clever dialogu (at time hilari stupid), it all work to that end - and thi realli move the movi away from the low-budget area to well-craft handwork.let talk a littl about the visual effects, becaus they are definit worth mentioning. noth featur digit visual effect and prosthet that equal ani modern horror film. there a rather horrifi dream sequenc in the film, and although the drew have milk that scene complet it still fun to watch. one of the best visual effect in the film is at the end where andrew and dave suddenli discov their power in thi environ - they have the abil to wish everyth away, so what if they can do it the other way around and make thing appear?\"nothing\" is a bright and well-lit movie, it realli help promot the idea of them probabl be dead (thi is in fact one of their theories), but \"nothing\" is a comedi and it slowli destroy it own theory. We dont know where they are or what ha happen to them. We dont know if they will ever get out, becaus the movi end befor we see anyth like that. the ending, by the way, is not as good as it couldv been. it rather easi to predict what is go to happen, still the writer have thought up a few incid that help make it a littl more interest and in the end, it a reason satisfactori one.tak \"hollow man\", \"kill bill\", \"cube\", \"epoch\" and lot of other film and you have \"nothing\". It realli is an amalgam of differ styles, still there is no other film (at least that I know of) noth is realli like. for the peopl rememb the origin cube product commentari on it dvd may rememb that vincenzo natali talk about how he came up with the stori of cube. He talk about him and andré bijel have been room-mat at a time and they both were in thi extrem dull room with no hope of get out, \"nothing\" could veri well be the screen version of the origin of the cube story, and to that end, it almost like one of the cube prequels.what can I say? I enjoy \"nothing\", it is a great movi and the differ part of the movi are extrem well-mad with ton of intellig ideas, still I feel the movi is miss someth and I have problem find out precis what it is... mayb if we have a \"noth 2\" I can answer that question. \"nothing\" is a great film, but not as good as I expect it to be.fin rating: 7.5 / 10',\n",

It is not quit correct to say, as ha often been said, that the film is about pimlico \"declar itself independent\" of britain. what happen is that an ancient charter come to light prove that in the fifteenth centuri the area wa cede by king edward IV to the duchi of burgundy. thi mean that, technically, pimlico is an independ state, and ha been for nearli five hundr years, irrespect of the wish of it inhabitants. the govern promis to pass a special act of parliament to rectifi the anomaly, but until the act receiv the royal assent the area remain outsid the unit kingdom and british law do not apply.becaus pimlico is not subject to british law, the landlord of the local pub is free to open whatev hour he choos and local shopkeep can sell whatev they pleas to whomev they please, unhind by the ration laws. when other trader start move into the area to sell their good in the streets, the british author are horrifi by what they regard as legalis black-market and seal off the area to tri and forc the \"burgundians\", as the peopl of pimlico have renam themselves, to surrender.mani of the eal comedi have as their central theme the idea of the littl man take on the system, either as an individu as happen in \"the man in the white suit\" or \"the lavend hill mob\", or as part of a larger commun as happen in \"whiski galore\" or \"the titfield thunderbolt\". the central theme of \"passport\" is that of ordinari men and women take on bureaucraci and government-impos regul which seem to be an increasingli import featur of life in the britain of the forties. the film particular target is the ration system. dure the war the system had been accept by most peopl as a necessari sacrific in the fight against nazism, but it becam increasingli polit controversi when the govern tri to retain it in peacetime. It wa a major factor in the grow unpopular of the attle administr which had been elect with a larg major in 1945, and organis such as the british housew leagu were set up to campaign for the abolit of rationing. I cannot agre with the review who state that the main target of the film satir were the \"spivs\" (black marketeers), who play a rel minor part in the action, or the housew league, who do not appear at all. the satir is veri much target at the bureaucrats, who are portray either as have a \"rule for rule sake\" mental or a desir to pass the buck and avoid have to take ani action at all.i suspect that if the film were to be made today it would have a differ end with pimlico remain independ as a british version of monaco or san marino. (indeed, I suspect that today thi concept would probabl serv as the basi of a TV sitcom rather than a film). In 1949, however, four year after the end of the war, the film-mak were keen stress patriot and british identity, so the film end with pimlico be reabsorb into britain. one of the best-known line from the film is \"we alway were english and we alway will be english and it just becaus we are english that were stick up for our right to be burgundians\". there is a sharp contrast between the rather heartless attitud of officialdom with the common sense, toler and good humour of the cockney of pimlico, all of which are present as be quintessenti british characteristics.most of the action take place dure a summer drought and swelter heatwave, but in the last scene, after pimlico ha rejoin the UK the temperatur drop and it start to pour with rain. global warm may have alter thing slightly, but for mani year part of be british wa the abil to hold the belief, whatev statist might say to the contrary, that britain had an abnorm wet climate. the abil to make joke about that climat wa equal important.ther is a good perform from stanley holloway as arthur pemberton, the grocer and small-tim local politician who becom the prime minist of free pimlico, and an amus cameo from margaret rutherford as a batti histori professor. In the main, however, thi is, appropri enough for a film about a small commun pull together, an exampl of ensembl act with no real star perform but with everyon make a contribut to an excel film. It lack the ill-wil and rancour of mani more recent satir films, but it wit and satir are no less effect for all that. It remain one of the funniest satir on bureaucraci ever made and, with the possibl except of \"kind heart and coronets\" is my person favourit among the eal comedies. 10/10',\n",
